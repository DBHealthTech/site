title: "Process Improvement"
---

<p>The day to day challenges of running your business, from staffing shortages to regulatory changes, can make it difficult to ensure your processes remain efficient as possible. Finding the time and resources to invest in identifying how technology can drive efficiencies often becomes a lower priority.</p>
<ul>
<li>Staff often continue using manual processes to complete tasks because they have "always done it this way" or because they do not have time to evaluate a more effective method</li>
<li>Technology continues to change and advance. Staff are often unaware of how technology could help them do their work more efficiently</li>
<li>EHR vendors continually update the functionality in the software to keep pace with industry and customer demands. Organizations may not have the staff or skillset to evaluate how new functionality can benefit the organization and provide a return on investment (ROI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations must contend with shrinking reimbursements, rising costs, and other external pressures while trying to remain relevant and competitive. Staff are busy providing care to clients. Yet your business processes, from the back office to the clinical areas, can be an area of opportunity for potential efficiencies and reduced cost.</p>
