The healthcare environment continues to change at a rapid pace, and so does technology.

- It can be difficult for an organization to keep pace with the changes and ensure they have an IT strategy that meets their business needs and keeps costs as low as possible.
- EHR functionality is continually enhanced to meet customer needs and regulatory requirements. Organizations may struggle to leverage the enhancements to drive efficiencies and quality.
- Organizations may not have the resources to employ the clinical or IT staff to drive the necessary technology changes.

Technology is increasingly important in the healthcare environment to drive efficiencies, meet regulatory requirements and to help organizations provide staff and client satisfaction. Technology can also help organizations stay competitive in their market with referral sources and with clients. Hospital systems and payers want partners who can help them to achieve their outcomes. Clients are demanding the latest technology to help them manage their health and stay connected.
