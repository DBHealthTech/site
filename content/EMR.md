<p>Implementing and maintaining an Electronic Health Record (EHR) is one of the most significant investments an organization will make.</p>
<ul>
<li>The EHR impacts multiple departments and processes, and if your organization is not optimizing the available functionality, the Return on Investment (ROI) may be reduced</li>
<li>Selecting a new EHR for your organization can be confusing and time-consuming</li>
<li>Implementing a new EHR requires significant resources, and requires careful planning and management in order for the implementation to be timely, on budget, and successful</li>
</ul>
<p>When your organization is implementing a new EHR, a strong partnership between IT and the business is critical. They need to clearly understand the long-term business and technology goals. Establishing a team with key players from impacted areas is important for the project to be successful from the EHR selection through post-implementation. Vendors play a key role, but they may not understand your business processes and operations.</p>
<p>It is important that your organization gets the most out of their EHR investment. Technology continues to change and so does an EHR.  It is a journey, and not a destination. Our knowledgeable team can work with your team to assess the use of your current system, and help you to develop a plan to optimize the functionality available in that system. If you are ready to move to a new system, we can assist you with the selection and/or the implementation process. </p>
